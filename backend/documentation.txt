// In early days javascript was used in frontend only as scripting language for the browser.
// In this period the javascript was not supported in the server , so python , java , php etc were used as backend.

// Later on the concept of nodejs was introduced as a runtime for javascript on the server side.
// Now the the runtime (nodejs) is responsibe for executing the javascript code on the server side.

// Node js(library) is the runtime prototype (protocol) which is complex and has a lot of features.
// Then Express js was introduced as the framework insted of core nodejs.

// API (Backend / Server ) 
// Application Programming Interface
// It serves as a bridge between frontend and database.

// Nodejs is environment and its framework are express,koa,meteor and more.
// Steps to create a backend server using express js
1. create a backend folder and go inside it
2. npm init -y
3. npm i express
4. npm i mongoose
5. "type": "module",--> add this in package.json
6. npm i nodemon --> keeps the server running (nodemon server.js)

// MongoDB
// MongoDB is a NoSQL database.
// It stores data in the form of documents and collections(JSON).
// Backend cannot talk to database directly, It should use mongoose to talk to the database.
